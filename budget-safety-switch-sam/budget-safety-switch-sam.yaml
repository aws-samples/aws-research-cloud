Description: |
  Budget-Safety-Switch-SAM.yaml: v1.0.0 -
  Budget Safety Switch packaged as a SAM template.
  Lambda function that iterates across all available regions and that stops
  instances without a KeepRunning Tag set (to any value). **Note that instance-backed
  ec2 instances will be terminated rather than stopped.**  It also sets Auto
  Scaling Groups without a Keep Running Tag to zero desired instances.
  This is designed to be deployed in the US-EAST-1 region, and to allow
  Budgets to trigger the shutdown (via SNS publish) when a threshold is exceeded.
Parameters:
  DebugMode:
    Type: String
    AllowedValues:
      - DEBUG
      - LIVE
    Default: DEBUG
    Description: Run in Debug or Live mode (Live mode actually stops instances)
  TagKey:
    Type: String
    Default: KeepRunning
    Description: The tag key to look for to ensure that instances are kept running
  TagValue:
    Type: String
    Default: True
    Description: The tag value to look for to ensure that instances are kept running
